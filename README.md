This repository contains a Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows a player to compete against the computer. The game follows the classic rules, where the player can choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer makes its choice randomly. The outcome is determined based on the standard rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. The game features a simple and user-friendly interface, providing immediate feedback on the results of each round. It's an engaging way to enjoy a timeless game while practicing programming concepts such as randomization and conditional logic.
